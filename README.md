PandaOS : An x86 based Hobby OS
========

I am doing this for studying the OS internals.

use the code as you like, with Original BSD license.

Any contribution is welcome :)

      step1: clone the code

      step2: cd Panda;
             ./do.sh
             (will run bochs or qemu,
			 you may need to do some modification for config Qeum/Bochs.
			 details ref do.sh)
